*Sharing is caring*. People always keep this on their mouth.
We are in the digital world, social media make it even easy to share. Everyday, people share their thought on Facebook/Twitter, share beutiful images on Instagram, share knowledge on medium or blog.

I guess this is sort of human nature. Everytime I learnt something new, or experienced something cool, I am eager to share. Not trying to show off, but more like I want them to feel me, or share this joy. Remember this is positive energy, spreading it all over the place is definately good things to do. Most of the time, people don't even care, so better be ready to get splash with cold water.

Next, blogging or simple text sharing, e.g. Twitter. Sharing thought perhaps, get attention from the world to listen to the voice of us. It brought good feeling when some supported your points, gave feedback or just like it. Again, this come from good feeling. However, this is just thought, like an opinion, not the real knowledge.

Technical article, medium, design. I see this more like sharing knowledge, and building reputaion. The content are usually work-related. When the knowledge shared are useful for others, I feel statisfy, won't show smile on the face, but will difinately dancing in the heart. Secondly, by doing this can also help people to recognize your works or even yourself, eventually this is somehow healty to your career path. Oh yeah! Open Source also can be categorized here.

Next, social media sharing. Posting a picture of you having fancy breakfast; Hipster photo at iKea Rack area? Sharing joys? Like my first points? But I will only do it to my close friends/family, why would i shared those to strangers. Can't find the expectation from there, really.

After all, I still like to share, except on social network.
